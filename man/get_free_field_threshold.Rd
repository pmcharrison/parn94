\usage{
get_free_field_threshold(kHz)
}
\arguments{
\item{kHz}{Numeric vector of frequencies in kHz}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of corresponding free-field thresholds in dB SPL
}
\description{
Returns the free-field threshold (dB SPL) of hearing in quiet for pure tones of given frequencies. This is the minimum sound level at which a pure tone at that frequency will be heard. Corresponds to Equation 2 in Parncutt & Strasburger (1994).
