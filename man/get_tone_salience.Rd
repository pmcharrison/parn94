\title{Get tone salience}
\usage{
get_tone_salience(combined_audibility, k_s)
}
\arguments{
\item{combined_audibility}{Numeric vector corresponding to the audibilities of each tone in the combined (pure and complex) spectrum}

\item{k_s}{Numeric scalar; Parncutt & Strasburger (1994) set this to 0.5}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of saliences of the same length as \code{combined_audibility}, giving the salience of each respective tone.
}
\description{
Gets the salience of different tones within a sonority with reference to the combined (complex and pure) spectrum. Salience can be interpreted as the probability of consciously perceiving a given pitch.
